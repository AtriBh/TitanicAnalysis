# Titanic Data Analysis 🛳️

This project explores the **Titanic dataset** to uncover patterns in **passenger survival** using visualizations created with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

## 📌 What I Did

* Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on key features: `pclass`, `sex`, `age`, `sibsp`, `parch`, `fare`, and `embarked`.
* Created attractive **bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots** to visualize survival trends.
* Analyzed survival rates based on:

  * **Gender** (higher survival for females)
  * **Class** (1st class had better survival chances)
  * **Family size** (`sibsp`, `parch` impact)
  * **Port of embarkation**

## 📂 Tools Used

* Python 🐍
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## 📈 Outcome

The analysis highlights how **socio-economic status, gender, and family dynamics** influenced survival during the Titanic disaster.
